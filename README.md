This repository contains the solutions for Assignment 3 of the TuteDude Python course. The project demonstrates a foundational understanding of functions, user input handling, and the application of built-in mathematical modules in Python.

Project Structure
task1.py: A script that calculates the factorial of a user-provided number using a custom function and a for loop. It includes validation to ensure factorials are only calculated for non-negative integers.

task2.py: A script that performs scientific calculations (Square Root, Natural Log, and Sine) using Python's native math module.
How to Run
